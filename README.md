# intoroman - A Lisp program to convert decimals to roman numbers
A Lisp program converting decimals to the roman representation

## Where does it come from?
I created this little program during my studies back in 2007. I created it in a seminar called "History of programming languages". I chose Lisp and made use of recursion in order to implement the transformation.

## How to use
To be honest, time flies and memories might vanish. But I figured that I can run the programm with the statement `(intoroman 2021)` when you want to know what the roman number representation of `2021` is. 

Anyhow: The statement has been added at the end of the file.
